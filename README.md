# ARM_Cortex_Traffic_Controller
A traffic signal controller built with an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller (TM4C), switches, LED's, FSM and the SysTick timer.
This traffic controller uses finite state machine (FSM) design to implement a one way street intersection traffic light signal controller.
It uses the SysTick timer built into the Cortex M4 for delays as well as has been tested on a breadboard.
